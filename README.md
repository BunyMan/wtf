<h1>What The Flip?</h1>
<div align="left">
    What The Flip will serve as a simple repo where I will learn how to develop a [FLIP simulation](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/18-flip.pdf) and try to do so in a few languages so I can test and challenge my skills.
    This is out of my comfort zone as I typically only do backend programming and don't really care about what is on the screen while my programs are running.
    I am still unsure about how many languages I will try and how I'll do the frontend for each of them (does ASCII art count as frontend?).
    I'll probably start in Python and move my way to C, C++, Rust, JS and so on.
    

    If you have any ideas on how to improve my code please create an issue so I can understand what is wrong and how to improve it.
